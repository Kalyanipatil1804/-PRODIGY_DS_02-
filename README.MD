# Titanic EDA Project

This project performs **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked`
- Dropped `Cabin` column due to excessive missing data
- Converted columns to appropriate data types

## 📊 EDA Highlights:
- Gender and class significantly affect survival
- First-class passengers had higher survival rate
- Females had higher survival rate than males
- Younger passengers tended to survive more

## 📁 Files Included:
- `titanic_eda.py` or `titanic_eda.ipynb`
- `train.csv`
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` (optional)
- Visualizations (if saved as .png)

## 🛠 Tools Used:
